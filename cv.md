### Summary:
I first came across HTML and CSS 15 years ago, when I was doing a small project for my friends. But then I couldn't develop in this direction. Now I want to change my profession and become a frontend developer. In the spring of 2020, I began to study HTML, CSS and JavaScript. I learned about the RSS course. I plan to finish this course, deepen my knowledge and start studying React. 
I am keen, honest, hard-working, purposeful and responsible. Know how to work in a team, connect easily with people. I am ready to learn.
